INTRODUCTION OF DEEP WEEB


Deep Web 101

What is the Deep Web?

The Deep Web refers to any Internet content that, for various reasons, can’t be or isn’t indexed by search
engines like Google. This definition thus includes dynamic web pages, blocked sites (like those that ask you

to answer a CAPTCHA to access), unlinked sites, private sites (like those that require login credentials), non-
HTML/-contextual/-scripted content, and limited-access networks.

Limited-access networks cover all those resources and services that wouldn’t be normally accessible with a
standard network configuration and so offer interesting possibilities for malicious actors to act partially or
totally undetected by law enforcers. These include sites with domain names that have been registered on
Domain Name System (DNS) roots that aren’t managed by the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names
and Numbers (ICANN) and, hence, feature URLs with nonstandard top-level domains (TLDs) that generally
require a specific DNS server to properly resolve. Other examples are sites that registered their domain name
on a completely different system from the standard DNS, like the .BIT domains we discussed in “Bitcoin
Domains [7]”. These systems not only escape the domain name regulations imposed by the ICANN; the
decentralized nature of alternative DNSs also makes it very hard to sinkhole these domains, if needed.
Also under limited-access networks are darknets or sites hosted on infrastructures that require the use of
specific software like TOR to access. Much of the public interest in the Deep Web lies in the activities that
happen inside darknets.
Unlike other Deep Web content, limited-access networks are not crawled by search engines though not
because of technical limitations. In fact, gateway services like tor2web offer a domain that allows users to
access content hosted on hidden services.
While the popular imagery for the Deep Web is an iceberg, we prefer to compare it to a subterranean mining
operation in terms of scale, volatility, and access. If anything above ground is part of the “searchable Internet,”
then anything below it is part of the Deep Web—inherently hidden, harder to get to, and not readily visible.

What are the uses of the Deep Web?
A smart person buying recreational drugs online wouldn’t want to type related keywords into a regular
browser. He/She will need to anonymously go online using an infrastructure that will never lead interested
parties to his/her IP address or physical location. Drug sellers wouldn’t want to set up shop in an online
location whose registrant law enforcement can easily determine or where the site’s IP address exist in the
real world, too.
There are many other reasons, apart from buying drugs, why people would want to remain anonymous
or set up sites that can’t be traced back to a physical location or entity. People who want to shield their
communications from government surveillance may require the cover of darknets. Whistleblowers may
want to share vast amounts of insider information to journalists without leaving a paper trail. Dissidents
in restrictive regimes may need anonymity in order to safely let the world know what’s happening in their
country.
On the flip side, people who want to plot the assassination of a high-profile target will want a guaranteed
but untraceable means. Other illegal services like selling documents such as passports and credit cards also
require an infrastructure that guarantees anonymity. The same can be said for people who leak other people’s
personal information like addresses and contact details.

The Surface Web versus the Deep Web
When discussing the Deep Web, it’s impossible for the “Surface Web” not to pop up. It’s exactly the opposite
of the Deep Web—that portion of the Internet that conventional search engines can index and standard web
browsers can access without the need for special software and configurations. This “searchable Internet” is
also sometimes called the “clearnet.”

The Dark Web versus the Deep Web
Much confusion lies between these two, with some outlets and researchers freely interchanging them. But the
Dark Web is not the Deep Web; it’s only part of the Deep Web. The Dark Web relies on darknets or networks
where connections are made between trusted peers. Examples of Dark Web systems include TOR, Freenet, or
the Invisible Internet Project (I2P) [8].
Taking on the mining tunnel metaphor, the Dark Web would be the deeper portions of the Deep Web that
require highly specialized tools or equipment to access. It lies deeper underground and site owners have more
reason to keep their content hidden.
